OVERVIEW
--------
What is DataReel?
Datareel is a comprehensive cross-platform C++ development kit used to
build multi-threaded database and communication applications. C++ is a
programming language that produces fast executing compiled programs
and offers very powerful programming capabilities. Unlike interpreted
languages such as JAVA and PERL the C++ language by itself does not
contain built-in programming interfaces for database, communications,
and multi-threaded programming. By using DataReel you can extend the
power of the C++ programming language by using high-level programming
interfaces for database, communications, and multi-threaded
programming.

The DataReel development package was produced by independent work and
contract work released to the public through non-exclusive license
agreements. The initial work began independently in 1997 and was
augmented from 1999 to 2004 by code produced under contract to support
various applications. Several developers throughout the World have
made contributions to enhance the DataReel code and promote its
stability. In 2005 the DataReel code library underwent intense
analysis to produce a bulletproof code base suitable for use in
complex commercial applications. 

Why Use DataReel?
DataReel simplifies complex time consuming database, socket, and
multi-threaded programming tasks by providing JAVA like programming
interfaces for database, communications, and multi-threaded
programming. Using DataReel you can harness the full power of the C++
programming language and build stable end-user applications, embedded
systems, and reusable libraries for multiple operating systems. 

DataReel is flexible. Using DataReel gives your developers the
flexibility to develop core application components independently of
complex user interfaces. DataReel is portable. DataReel not only
offers portability but also interoperability between multiple
platforms. DataReel is modular. DataReel is a modular approach to
network and database programming making code adaptation and
cross-platform testing easy. 

Who Can Use DataReel?
The DataReel toolkit is available to commercial, individual, and
academic developers. The DataReel code base is distributed to the
public in an open source format. This keeps the code stable through
the continued support of worldwide developers who submit code
enhancements and report potential problems. The open source format is
also intended to promote the C++ programming language as the language
of choice for any programming task. 

Who Can Contribute?
The DataReel project accepts bug fixes, enhancements, and additions
from all developers. Submissions can be sent directly to the DataReel
Software Development Team via email or online using Web forms. Please
visit the DataReel Website at http://www.datareel.com for the current
team contact information.

programs are located within subdirectories of the "examples.gen",
"examples.db", "examples.mt", and "examples.soc" directories. NOTE: In
release 4.X you must build the DataReel library before building any of
the example or utility programs. All examples and utilities are built
using an include makefile located in the env subdirectory. 

WIN32 Makefiles
msvc.mak - Microsoft Visual C/C++ 6.0 SP3 or Microsoft Visual C++ .NET
bcc32.mak - Borland BCC32 5.5

UNIX Makefiles
hpux10.mak - HPUX front-end compiler
hpux11.mak - HPUX aCC compiler
linux.mak - gcc compiler
solaris.mak - Sun WorkShop C++ compiler

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
The complete DataReel 4.X documentation set is available in an HTML
format. The DataReel HTML documentation set is distributed with each
DataReel source code distribution. Updated versions and all changes
are posted to the DataReel Web Site: 

http://www.datareel.com/documentation/

UNZIPPING
---------
The entire DataReel distribution requires approximately 8 MB of free
disk space to unpack. Two distributions are available, one for Windows
and one for UNIX. The DataReel Windows and UNIX archives are identical
and can be unpacked on either platform depending on the decompression
tools available to you.  

Windows Installation
To unpack this distribution on a Windows platform you will need a copy
of PKZIP version 2.03 for DOS or WINZIP version 6.1 or higher for
WIN32. To unzip using PKZIP 2.03 follow these instructions:  

C:\>mkdir datareel
C:\>copy dreelXXX.zip c:\datareel
C:\>cd datareel
C:\datareel>pkunzip -d dreelXXX.zip

UNIX Installation
To unpack this distribution you need a copy GZIP/GUNZIP version 1.2.4
or higher. To unpack using GZIP and the UNIX tar utility follow these
instructions:  

% gzip -d dreelXXX.tgz
% tar xvf dreelXXX.tar

To unpack using GUNZIP and the UNIX tar utility follow these instructions:

% gunzip dreelXXX.tgz 
% tar xvf dreelXXX.tar

To unpack using the UNIX uncompress utility follow these instructions:

% zcat dreelXXX.tar.Z | tar xvf -

NOTE: You can also use the UNIX uncompress utility to unpack GZIP files:

% zcat dreelXXX.tgz | tar xvf -

NOTE: You can also use UNZIP for UNIX version 5.12 or higher to unpack
the zip archive: 

% mkdir datareel
% cp dreelXXX.zip datareel/dreelXXX.zip
% cd datareel

% unzip -a -L dreelXXX.zip

The unzip "-a" option will auto-convert all text files to a UNIX
format and the "-L" option will make the directory and file names all
lower case.  

BUILDING THE BCC STATIC WIN32 LIBRARY
-------------------------------------
The BCC32 makefiles requires you to build the BCC static library are
located in the winslib subdirectory. To build the library using the
BCC make utility execute the following command:  

C:\DataReel\winslib>make -f bcc32.mak 

This will build the 32-bit static library. To build the 64-bit library
you must uncomment the following line in the winslib\bcc32.env file
and rebuild the static library: 

64BIT_DEFMACS = -D__64_BIT_DATABASE_ENGINE__

C:\DataReel\winslib>make -f bcc32.mak clean
C:\DataReel\winslib>make -f bcc32.mak

NOTE: Before building the example programs or the utility programs
using the BCC compiler you must set the absolute path to the DataReel
library in the env\bcc.mak file: 
 
GCODE_LIB_DIR = C:\DataReel 

If you are using the Borland IDE to build the library, examples, or
utility programs please refer to the winslib\bcc32.env file for the
required preprocessor directives, library dependencies, compiler and
linker flags.  

BUILDING THE MSVC OR C++.NET DLL
--------------------------------
The MSVC/C++.NET makefiles requires you to build the MSVC DLL are
located in the dll subdirectory. To build the DLL using the MSVC/
C++.NET nmake utility execute the following command:  

C:\DataReel\dll>nmake -f msvc.mak 

The will build both the 32-bit release and debug DLLs and place them
in the C:\DataReel\dll\release and C:\DataReel\dll\debug
directories. If you are using the MSVC or C++.NET Visual Studio to
build the library, examples, or utility programs please refer to the
dll\msvc.env file for the required preprocessor directives, library
dependencies, compiler and linker flags.  

To build the 64-bit DLL execute the following commands:

C:\DataReel\dll>nmake -f msvc.mak clean
C:\DataReel\dll>nmake -f msvc.mak 64BITCFG=1

NOTE: Before any executable can be launched you must install the DLL
or set a path to the DLL. The DLL can be installed in the directory
with the executable, in the Windows system directory, or be visible in
any set path. To set the DLL path for the current console window
execute the following command: 

C:\>set path=%path%;C:\DataReel\dll\release;C:\DataReel\dll\debug

BUILDING THE MSVC OR C++.NET STATIC LIBRARY
-------------------------------------------
To build the static library using the MSVC/C++.NET nmake utility
execute the following command: 

C:\DataReel\winslib\>nmake -f msvc.mak 

This will build the 32-bit debug library. To build the release library
utility execute the following commands:

C:\DataReel\winslib\>nmake -f msvc.mak clean
C:\DataReel\winslib\>nmake -f msvc.mak FINAL=1

To build the 64-bit static library execute the following commands:

C:\DataReel\winslib\>nmake -f msvc.mak clean
C:\DataReel\winslib\>nmake -f msvc.mak FINAL=1 64BITCFG=1

If you are using the MSVC or C++.NET Visual Studio to build the
library, examples, or utility programs please refer to the
winslib\msvc.env file for the required preprocessor directives,
library dependencies, compiler and linker flags.  

NOTE: None of the example or utility programs will link to the
MSVC/C++.NET static library. If wish to link to the static library
instead of the dynamic one you must modify the msvc include makefile
located in the env subdirectory.  

BUILDING UNIX SHARE AND STATIC LIBRARIES
----------------------------------------
The UNIX makefiles require you to build the UNIX static/shared
libraries located in the unixlib subdirectory. To build the library
using the UNIX make utility execute the following command for one of
the supported UNIX platforms:  

% make -f linux.mak
% make -f solaris.mak
% make -f hpux10.mak
% make -f hpux11.mak 

This will generate the "libgxcode.a" static 32-bit library and the
"libgxcode.so.4.X" shared 32-bit library. To build the 64-bit library
for Linux, Solaris, or HPUX 11 you must uncomment the following line
in the unixlib/linux.mak, unixlib/solaris.mak, or unixlib/hpux11.mak
makefile and rebuild the library: 

64BIT_DEFMACS = -D__64_BIT_DATABASE_ENGINE__ -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE

% make -f linux.mak clean
% make -f linux.mak

% make -f solaris.mak clean
% make -f solaris.mak

% make -f hpux11.mak clean
% make -f hpux11.mak

NOTE: By default the example and utility programs will link to the
static version unless the libgxcode.so.4.X is symbolically linked or
renamed to libgxcode.so in the unixlib build directory. Before
executing any executable linked to a shared UNIX library you must make
the library visible to the system's dynamic loader. To do this either
install the library in a default lib directory such as /usr/local/lib,
/usr/lib, or /lib or set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
equal to the absolute path of the directory containing the
library. NOTE: Before setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH check to see if the
variable has already been set: 

echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH 

If the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable is not set execute one of the
following commands depending on which shell you are using: 

/bin/csh
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/datareel/dreelXXX/lib

/bin/sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/datareel/dreelXXX/lib 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable is set execute one of the following
commands depending on which shell you are using: 

/bin/csh
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/datareel/dreelXXX/dlib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
   
/bin/sh   
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/datareel/dreelXXX/dlib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

To install the library in the DataReel lib directory execute a "make
install" from the command line. This will copy the libgxcode.a and
libgxcode.so.4.X files to the DataReel lib directory and create a
symbolic link from libgxcode.so.4.X to libgxcode.so. NOTE: When a UNIX
compiler sees both a static and shared library in the same directory
it will always link to the shared library first.
